# Development roadmap

To do: 




* Dynamic soundtrack

* New collision model: pixel-perfect collisions? 

* Add random events to destabilize lurking equilibria

* Change the sword behavior so it is more intuitive and less invincible

* Make swords colorful

* Add gameover / score screen

* Add some kind of version record to logs

* Art overhaul

* Decide on a name

* Decide on marketing / release plan (probably: free, haphazard)

Done: 

* Menu display

* Ability to start and finish games w/o closing and restarting Haystack
